# Dotfiles
Personal dotfiles for basic tools.
##### Included:
* **for both Linux and Mac:**
  - `tmux`
  - `vim`
  - `vscode` (separate for each system)
    * Key bindings
    * Settings (note: these are general settings. For specific projects, detailed workspace settings should be added)
  - `zsh`
    * I modified the original dracula theme [(link)](https://github.com/dracula/zsh).
* **for Linux:**
  - `rofi`
  - `xfce4`
    * Terminal settings + color scheme
    * Keyboard shortcuts

Note: in `tmux` and `zsh` I use **dracula** themes [(link)](https://draculatheme.com/).
In `vim` and `vscode` I use **darcula** themes (based on the original one from JetBrains IDEs)
