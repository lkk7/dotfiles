# Dotfiles

Personal dotfiles for basic tools. Attempted to keep as simple as possible.

##### Included:

- **for Linux and Mac:**
  - `vscode`
    - Minimal user settings. No language-specific ones for formatters, linters, and other tools, because they are really dependent on a specific project â€“ they should be added to workspace settings.
  - `zsh`
    - I modified the original dracula theme [(link)](https://github.com/dracula/zsh).
  - `tmux`
  - `vim`
- **Linux only:**
  - `rofi`
  - `xfce4`
    - Terminal settings + color scheme
    - Keyboard shortcuts

---

Note: in `tmux` and `zsh` I use **dracula** themes [(link)](https://draculatheme.com/).
In `vim` and `vscode` I use **darcula** themes (based on the original one from JetBrains IDEs)
